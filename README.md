# crystal_app

This is my first Crystal-Lang application. The idea is to consume an API
(to be defined) and have it render to a nice HTML page.

## Installation

- Clone Repo https://github.com/rsbarbo/crystal_app
- Install Sentry `curl -fsSLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samueleaton/sentry/master/install.rb | ruby`
- Check your `shard.yml` file for dependencies:

```
dependencies:
  kemal:
    github: kemalcr/kemal
    branch: master
```

- Update you shard by running `shards update` on your terminal.
